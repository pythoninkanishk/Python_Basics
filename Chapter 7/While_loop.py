# This program demonstrates a simple while loop in Python.
# It initializes a variable i to 0, then repeatedly increments i by 1 and prints its value.
# The loop continues as long as i is less than 50, so it prints numbers from 1 to 50.

# i = 0
# while i < 5:
#     i = i + 1
#     print(i)

# Quiz 1. Write a program to print the content of a list using while loops.
i = 0
while (i<50):
    i = i + 1
    print(i)
