# Arithematic operators
A = 10 
B = 20
C = A +  B #Addition
# similarly we can use -*/ for substraction, multiplication and division


# comparison operator 
D = A > B #Greater than
E = A < B #Less than    
F = A == B #Equal to
G = A != B #Not equal to  
# WE CAN ALSO USE >= AND <= FOR GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO AND LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO  

#Assignment operator
H = A #Assigns the value of A to H  
I = 33 
I -= 3 #Subtracts 3 from I and assigns the result to I
# I *= 2 #Multiplies I by 2 and assigns the result to I   
# I += 5 #Adds 5 to I and assigns the result to I
# I /= 2 #Divides I by 2 and assigns the result to I

# Logical operators
Z = True or False
print(Z) 

# Truth table of 'or'
print("True or False is", True or False)
print( "True or True is ", True or True)
print("False or True is", False or True)
print("False or False is", False or False)

# Truth table of 'and' 
print("True and False is", True and False)
print( "True and True is ", True and True)
print("False and True is", False and True)
print("False and False is", False and False)

#not operator
print(not(True))
# jo true ko false or ko true bna de usse not operator kehte hain
